Fuel-Smart Traffic Optimization for Mileage Efficiency

This is the project that we created during the course of DevSoc'23 conducted by codechef at VIT Vellore.

The project aims to lower fuel use and improve mileage for the average user. It uses google's javascript and routes API to make the webpage user friendly for everyone to use. The user will be able to input his start and destination location and in turn will recieve the fastest route to travel along with the speeds in which he would need to travel the different stretches of the path so that he/she never encounters a red light along the way.
This eliminates traffic jams and also saves a lot of fuel for the user, which is a huge incentive amid rising fuel prices.
